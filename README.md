### Overview

- A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft that is in flight or 
on a take-off or landing roll.
- Bird Strikes are common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. It has also resulted in several fatal accidents.
- Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial 
climb, approach, and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels.
- Analyzing the bird strike data holds significant value in ensuring the safe travel of passengers 
and lowering business costs due to aircraft damage by avoiding such incidents.
